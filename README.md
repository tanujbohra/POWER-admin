# POWER-admin
The admin side of the POWER portal enables admins to approve/reject projects that have been uploaded to the POWER portal. It provides the admin with various analytics using visualization. It also alerts admin when malicious content has been posted on the site using Machine Learning allowing admin to block the user/project.
